# CG - Whitechurch, Durham, in-WebGL
In this project, we model Whitechurch - a bar/restauraunt in Durham, opposite the Durham University Library. We render the scene in OpenGL for web browsers, and include interactive elements, such as:
- Streetlight toggling
- Opening/closing a dumpster
- Opening/closing the front door of Whitechurch
Also included is an animated car, circling the building.
